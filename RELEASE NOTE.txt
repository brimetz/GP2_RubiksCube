The user interface is composed a following:
    - A slider to choose the size of Rubik's cube you want to try to solve
    - A button to create a new Rubik's cube
    - A slider and an input field to choose the depth of the scrambling
    - A button to start scrambling
    - A button to reset the timer
    - A button to start/resume the timer
    - A button to exit the game

Inputs:
    Right Click  - Rotate the cube around itself
    Left Click   - Move a face of the cube
    Mouse Scroll - Move the camera toward/away from the cube
    R            - To reset the timer
    Space        - To start/resume the timer

If the cube is solved while the timer is running, it will automatically stop and reward you with nice firework effects.

The Rubik's cube has been created using the MVC design pattern:
    - RubiksCubeModel 				  being the model;
    - RubiksCube_RappeneckerBastienRimetzBaptiste being the controller;
    - RubiksCubeView 				  being the view;

All the values can be accessed and modified from the Unity Editor to make a better user experience.
